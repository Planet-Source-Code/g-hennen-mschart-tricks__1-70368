Chart Tricks

This program was created using MSchart control 6.00.00.

If you try to load the forms and get a log error you probably have a different MSChart verison. Simply add your version of MSChart to the Toolbox and drag the component to each form.  Fill each form completely with MSChart.  The code contains the proper MSChart settings needed.

Note: don't resize the forms at this time. You can adjust original form sizes once you dig into the code.
